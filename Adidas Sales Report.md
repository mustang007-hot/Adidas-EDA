### Project Overview
---
This project analyzes Adidas sales data to uncover key trends in product performance, regional demand, sales channels, and seasonality. The goal of the analysis was to identify high-performing products and markets, understand customer purchasing patterns, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve sales and profitability.

The analysis revealed that Men’s Street Footwear recorded the highest sales across all product categories, closely followed by Women’s Apparel, highlighting these as Adidas’ strongest revenue drivers. Sales trends also showed clear seasonal peaks, with significant increases between July and August and another spike in December, aligning with summer demand and holiday shopping periods.

From a sales channel perspective, in-store purchases dominated overall sales, accounting for over 39% of total sales, indicating that physical retail locations continue to play a major role in customer purchasing behavior despite the growth of online shopping.

Regionally, the West emerged as the highest-performing region in terms of total sales, with the Northeast following closely behind by a large margin. At the city level, Charleston and New York stood out as top-performing cities, recording the highest sales figures with only a narrow gap between them.

Based on these insights, the project recommends doubling down on Men’s Street Footwear and Women’s Apparel through increased inventory focus, targeted marketing, and product investment to maximize revenue and profit. Additionally, launching promotional campaigns earlier in the summer is advised to capitalize on seasonal demand and drive stronger sales performance before peak periods.

Overall, this project demonstrates how sales data can be transformed into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making in product prioritization, regional marketing, and seasonal planning.

##### Key Insights Derived from the Data

- Men’s Street Footwear recorded the highest sales and units sold, making it the strongest-performing product category.

- Women’s Apparel closely followed, confirming strong demand across both men’s and women’s product lines.

- Sales exhibit clear seasonal peaks, with noticeable increases during July–August (summer demand) and December (holiday shopping).

- In-store sales remain the dominant sales method, accounting for over 39% of total sales, indicating strong reliance on physical retail.

- The West region generated the highest total sales, with the Northeast following behind by a significant margin.

- Charleston and New York emerged as top-performing cities, recording the highest sales with a narrow gap between them.

- High-selling categories also maintain competitive operating margins, suggesting they are not only popular but also profitable.

- Pricing varies across product categories, but demand remains strong for categories with mid-range pricing and strong brand appeal.


#### <b>Recommendations Based On The Analysis</b>

- Double Down on High-Performing Product Categories<br>
Men’s Street Footwear and Women’s Apparel consistently generate the highest sales and maintain strong profitability. Adidas should prioritize these categories through increased inventory allocation, expanded product lines, and focused marketing campaigns to maximize revenue growth.

- Launch Promotions Ahead of Peak Seasonal Demand<br>
Sales data shows clear spikes during July–August and December. Promotional campaigns should begin before these peak periods—particularly in early summer—to capture rising demand and increase both sales volume and operating profit.

- Strengthen In-Store Sales Strategy<br>
With in-store purchases contributing over 39% of total sales, Adidas should continue investing in physical retail experiences. This includes improved in-store merchandising, targeted regional promotions, and optimized inventory placement in high-traffic locations.

- Prioritize High-Revenue Regions and Cities<br>
The West region and Northeast consistently outperform other regions, while cities like Charleston and New York lead in sales. Marketing spend, product launches, and store-level optimization should be concentrated in these high-performing markets to maximize returns.

- Align Inventory Planning with Regional Demand Patterns<br>
Regional and city-level performance differences suggest varying customer preferences. Adidas should use demand insights to allocate inventory more efficiently, reducing stockouts in top markets and minimizing excess inventory in underperforming regions.

- Protect and Scale Profitability Alongside Sales Growth<br>
Since top-selling products also maintain strong operating margins, growth strategies should focus on scaling volume without aggressive discounting that could erode profitability. Data-backed pricing and controlled promotions will help sustain long-term margins.

#### Business Impact

Implementing these recommendations positions Adidas to:

- Increase revenue from proven product categories

- Capture demand earlier during peak seasons(July & August) & The Holidays

- Maximize ROI by focusing on high-performing regions and cities

- Sustain profitability while scaling sales volume
