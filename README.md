### Project Overview
---
This project analyzes Adidas sales data to uncover key trends in product performance, regional demand, sales channels, and seasonality. The goal of the analysis was to identify high-performing products and markets, understand customer purchasing patterns, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve sales and profitability.

The analysis revealed that Men’s Street Footwear recorded the highest sales across all product categories, closely followed by Women’s Apparel, highlighting these as Adidas’ strongest revenue drivers. Sales trends also showed clear seasonal peaks, with significant increases between July and August and another spike in December, aligning with summer demand and holiday shopping periods.

From a sales channel perspective, in-store purchases dominated overall sales, accounting for over 39% of total sales, indicating that physical retail locations continue to play a major role in customer purchasing behavior despite the growth of online shopping.

Regionally, the West emerged as the highest-performing region in terms of total sales, with the Northeast following closely behind by a large margin. At the city level, Charleston and New York stood out as top-performing cities, recording the highest sales figures with only a narrow gap between them.

Based on these insights, the project recommends doubling down on Men’s Street Footwear and Women’s Apparel through increased inventory focus, targeted marketing, and product investment to maximize revenue and profit. Additionally, launching promotional campaigns earlier in the summer is advised to capitalize on seasonal demand and drive stronger sales performance before peak periods.

Overall, this project demonstrates how sales data can be transformed into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making in product prioritization, regional marketing, and seasonal planning.
